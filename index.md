### Data Analyst

I use SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and R to turn data into business insights.

## About Me

I’m a data analyst with a strong academic background in mathematics and a passion for using data to solve practical business problems.

I enjoy working through complex questions methodically — breaking messy datasets into structured pieces, building clean SQL logic, and translating results into clear insights that non-technical audiences can understand and act on. My approach to analytics is shaped by years of explaining difficult concepts in simple terms, whether in classrooms, tutoring sessions, or one-on-one settings.

Before moving fully into data analytics, I spent several years teaching and tutoring mathematics, which strengthened both my analytical thinking and my communication skills. That experience taught me how to tell clear stories with numbers, anticipate questions, and focus on what actually matters to the person on the receiving end of the information.

Today, I focus on projects involving profitability analysis, customer behavior, and operational performance using tools like SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. I’m especially interested in applying analytics in business and e-commerce environments, where data-driven decisions can have immediate, measurable impact.
